If your Angular library doesn't have a `styles.css` file by default, you can create one and configure it to work with Tailwind CSS. Here’s how to add Tailwind CSS without relying on an existing `styles.css` file:

### Steps to Add Tailwind CSS to Your Angular Library

#### Step 1: Create a Styles File
Even though your Angular library doesn't have a `styles.css` file, you can manually create one.

1. **Create a `styles.css` or `styles.scss` file** (if you prefer SCSS) in the library, for example:
   ```
   projects/your-lib/src/lib/styles.css
   ```

#### Step 2: Add Tailwind Directives to Your Styles File
Add Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities to your new `styles.css` (or `styles.scss`):

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### Step 3: Include the Styles in `angular.json`
Make sure that the Angular CLI is aware of this new `styles.css` file so it can be processed during the build.

1. Open the `angular.json` file and find your library’s configuration. It should be under `projects -> your-lib -> architect -> build`.

2. Add the newly created `styles.css` file under the `options` for your library’s build section:

```json
"projects": {
  "your-lib": {
    "architect": {
      "build": {
        "options": {
          "styles": [
            "projects/your-lib/src/lib/styles.css"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure Tailwind with PostCSS
If you haven’t already set up Tailwind with PostCSS, create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your Angular workspace:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

#### Step 5: Configure `tailwind.config.js`
Make sure you have a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then modify the `purge` option to include paths for both the consuming app and the library:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './projects/your-lib/src/**/*.html',
    './projects/your-lib/src/**/*.ts',
    './src/**/*.html',  // Include paths for the consuming app
    './src/**/*.ts',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

#### Step 6: Import Library Styles in Consuming Application
Once Tailwind CSS is properly set up in your library, you need to import the library’s `styles.css` in the consuming Angular application.

1. Open the consuming Angular app’s `angular.json`.
2. Add your library’s `styles.css` file to the `styles` array of the application, like this:

```json
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "projects/your-lib/src/lib/styles.css"
]
```

### Step 7: Use Tailwind CSS Classes in the Library
Now you can use Tailwind CSS classes in your Angular library’s components just as you would in a normal Angular project.

### Summary
- Create a new `styles.css` file for your Angular library.
- Add Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind base;`, etc.) to that file.
- Update `angular.json` to ensure the library’s styles are included in the build.
- Make sure to import the library’s styles in the consuming application as well.
